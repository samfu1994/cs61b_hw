<p>

Each link below leads to a directory with a readme file containing the
homework or project,
a readme.ps PostScript file which neatly and compactly formats
the readme file, an identical PDF file called readme.pdf,
and whatever additional files you need to do the assignment.
These files are also available through the directory <tt>~cs61b/hw</tt>.
<p>

All homeworks and projects are due at noon (right before class) on Wednesdays.
Late homeworks will <b>not</b> be accepted, no matter what.
We drop your lowest homework grade to help you negotiate one crisis week
during the semester, so please don't ask for extensions.
Late projects will be penalized by 1% of your earned score for
every two hours (rounded up) they are late.
